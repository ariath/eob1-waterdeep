
v0.02.14 (not released yet)
- (JKos) Grimwidgets and LoG Framework updated. (sorry about previous accidental commit)
- (Thomson) Grimwidgets framework integrated. Currently only compass is functional.
- (DJ) New sewer wallset: 
      - models and textures
	  - clean up the old model/texture files
	  - changes in scripts
	  - need little more testing...

v0.02.13 (2012-12-31)
- (Thomson) Initial early version of events added. Example is on (15,13), level 4
- (DJ) Added iron sewer doors
- (JKos) Improved t-script entity and added a new entity object 'testpoint', which is a cloned script entity with starting location icon.
	- You can place testpoint to dungeon and write the test scripts in them
	- Testpoints can be executed by calling t.run(testpoint_id), which teleports the party to testpoint's location and executes the activate function of testpoint
	- Added t.list(entityName, [level]), which list all entities whose name matches to the entityName even paritially. Level is optional. 
	- All t.functions can be used in game too if the console is activated, I tested it and they don't break savegames or anything.
- (Thomson) Imported 1.3 version of spider webs. Added torn spider webs for level 4 (spider webs textures are now much smaller)
- (JKos) Fixed illusion walls and moved script entity illusion_walls to dungeon for easier debugging.
- (JKos) added script entity "t" for testing purposes. Located on lower right corner of the 1st level. (see comments from the script)
- (Thomson) added teleporters to levels 4-12 (useful for testing)
- (JKos) Updated LoG Framework to the latest version (includes Xanathars GrimQ library)
- (JKos) New spells: Stoneskin, cone of cold, fireball, lightning bolt, ice storm, haste
- (JKos) All custom monsters, doors and items now work with the framework, so it's now possible to use dynamic hooks with custom assets.
- (JKos) Bug fix: mage leveling above level 15 causes crash
- (Thomson) Added breakable spider nets on level 4 (model by montagneyaya)
- (Thomson) Added slug (as leech) by Wallasaurus
- (Thomson) Integrated files generated by EobConverter 0.6.7:
   - levels 4-12,
   - dummy item definitions for all levels
   - items placed in levels 4-12,
   - monster definitions for all levels
   - monster placed in levels 4-12
