This is a recreation of 1990s game Eye of the Beholder I in the
engine of Grimrock.

The primary webpage for this work is 
http://www.oldgames.sk/disc/eye-of-the-beholder-remake-grimrock/.

The goal of this project is to recreate the original as close as possible.
This is a non-commercial hobby project.


There are other recreation projects out there. This is not a race. We consider
other attempts not as competition, but rather as fellow EOB fans that are
working toward similar goal to ours. We are glad to share whatever we have.
Feel free to use our stuff, regardless if you want to share yours or not.

This is an open project. Anyone interested is welcome to join. The rules are
simple: you agree to share results of your work, agree for others to build upon
it and modify it further to work toward as close EOB recreation as possible.

Almost Human - Thank you for an experience that we hadn't had since 90's. You
made possible for us to venture into the dark depths of countless dungeons and
get a thrill we missed for so long.
